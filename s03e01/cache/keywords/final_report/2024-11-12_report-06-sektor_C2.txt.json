{ "reasoning": "The report focuses on the security and operational status of the north-western sector, which is considered stable without any detected disturbances. The related fact describes Sector C as a highly secure area for testing advanced weaponry with automated monitoring systems, suggesting a general theme of security and surveillance. However, the report does not mention any specific link to weapon testing or special security protocols from the facts. Although the report and fact are both related to sectors with security measures, their operational focuses differ. The 'to-checks' do not directly relate to the report or fact; hence they don't impact the keyword selection. No person or incident from the 'to-checks' influences the report's context, and Barbara Zawadzka's fingerprints are not linked to the report. Thus, there are no changes in specific individuals impacting the keyword selection.", "keywords": "sektor północno-zachodni, stabilny stan, skanery temperatury, brak wykrycia, jednostka operacyjna, patrol, bezpieczeństwo, monitorowanie" }
