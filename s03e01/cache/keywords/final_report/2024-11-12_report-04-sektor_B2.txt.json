  "reasoning": "The report '2024-11-12_report-04-sektor_B2.txt' describes a routine patrol with no anomalies or deviations from the norm, indicating a stable and safe environment. This does not directly connect to the related facts provided in 'f06.txt' and 'f07.txt'. 'f06.txt' discusses Azazel, a mysterious figure related to the resistance and advanced technology, while 'f07.txt' describes Rafał Bomba, a lab technician involved in advanced experiments with mental instability. The report does not mention any persons, unusual phenomena, or advanced technologies that could relate to the figures in the facts. Additionally, the 'to-checks' do not reveal any relevant connections to the report. Therefore, the original keywords accurately capture the contents of the report while no additional context from the facts can be directly applied.",
